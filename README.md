# Git tutorial

This tutorial is intended to be a brief introduction to git and GitHub features. Why we use them, basic commands and a short lab.

# Usage

Instructions can be found in `presentation.ipynb`.

You can also serve the notebook in slides format using *(Jupyter and reveal.js are required - you should be fine if you have Anaconda)*:

```
jupyter nbconvert presentation.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```
